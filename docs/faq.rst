Is Elemeta ready for public use?
==================================
Elemeta is still in open beta. We've tested it both internally and in closed beta, but take in mind that this is still (and will always be) a work in progress. So if you see anything that doesn't seem quite right or would like to add something to the project, please open a `GitHub issue <https://github.com/>`__!


Is Elemeta part of Superwise?
==================================
Elemeta is an open-source project developed and maintained by the data science team at `Superwise <https://superwise.ai/>`_. We originally developed the Elemeta capabilities to enhance our model observability capabilities in NLP and vision and shifted to an open-source approach with the realization of additional applications in the fields of EDA and feature extraction. Elemeta is and always will be free and open-source software, and we are more than happy to accept community contributions.

Security
=================
Elemeta does not send any information or open any port. All information is calculated locally.

Community
============
Elemeta is brand new, so we don't have a formal process for contributions just yet. If you have feedback or would like to contribute, just go ahead and post a `GitHub issue <https://github.com/superwise-ai/elemeta/issues>`_.
