Elemeta: Metafeature Extraction for Unstructured Data
======================================================

Elemeta is an open-source library in Python for metafeature extraction. With it, you will be able to explore, monitor, and extract features from unstructured data through enriched tabular representations. It provides a straightforward Python API for metadata extraction from unstructured data like text and images.
Key usage of Elemeta includes:

- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) - extract useful metadata information on unstructured data to analyze, investigate, and summarize the main characteristics and employ data visualization methods.
- Data and model monitoring - utilize structured ML monitoring techniques in addition to the typical latent embedding visualizations.
- Feature extraction - engineer alternative features to be utilized in simpler models such as decision trees.
