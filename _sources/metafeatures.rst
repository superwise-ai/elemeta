========================
Metafeatures
========================
| Within Elemeta, metafeatures are currently split into two groups of metrics, statistical metrics and contextual metrics. Statistical metrics calculate technical values such as word length, word count, etc., and contextual metrics extract information regarding the context of the text.
| Here you can find explanations on all exiting metafeatures and usage examples.
| You can see the full API reference `here <https://docs.elemeta.ai/elemeta.nlp.extractors.high_level.html>`_
