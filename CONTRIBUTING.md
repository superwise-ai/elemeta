2. Fork the repository.
3. Make your changes in your local branch.

## <a id="guidelines"></a>Guidelines:

### Formatting and linting

We use isort and black formatters in Elemeta. To apply these formats automatically using [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/#install), please run the following command from the repo root:

```sh
pre-commit run --all-files
```

To make sure that formatting and linting rules are applied, you can install a Git hook that will run `pre-commit` on each commit:

```sh
pre-commit install
```

### Documentation

Always make sure that you update the docs regardless if you applied code changes directly or if your contribution was direct to the package documentation! Please first run the documentation build step locally to ensure it looks good. To build the documentation run:

```sh
./scripts/docs.sh
open docs/_build/html/index.html
```

### Tests

Before committing any new code change, please run the full test suite to ensure its quality and coverage. To do this, please run

```sh
./scripts/test.sh
```

You can run the script directly by running the following: `Poetry run pytest`
but the _test.sh_ script is recommended as it will ensure that the test coverage is above the required coverage level.

### Commit format

We love a good and concise commit message ðŸ˜‰, and in addition, commit messages will automatically create the package versions and changelog based on [conventional commit](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/#summary) messages.
The full list of supported commit types can be found in the release [configuration](https://github.com/superwise-ai/elemeta/blob/main/.releaserc.json#L11C32-L17).

#### **When changing code**

When a code changes and the following commit types are used, a new version is created and published using [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/superwise-ai/elemeta/actions/workflows/release.yaml).

| Commit message                                                                                                                                                | Version type | When to use                                                                                                                                 |
